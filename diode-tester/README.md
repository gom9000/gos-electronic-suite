# Diode tester
A simple tester to measure, under different current values, the voltage drop across a diode when forward biased, or the working voltage of a Zener diode when reverse biased.<br/>
The circuit may be powered with a DC-Adapter $12VDC$ or $24VDC$, obviously the maximum measurable zener voltage depends on the supply voltage.<br/>
The circuit allows you to test different types of diodes, which require different minimum activation currents. For this reason, the current flowing in the diode under test can be selected by a variable resistor, from a minimum of about $1.5mA$ up to $50mA$. This also allows you to observe the variations in voltage, voltage drop or Zener, for different current values.

## Requirements

### Circuit Analysis
**Load driver network:**<br/>
The load current must be adjustable between $1.0mA$ and $30mA$:

$I_{C3} = V_{BE2}/R_3$

Assuming $V_{BE2} = 0.7V  \implies$
- $R_{3_{1.0mA}} = 700\Omega \implies R_{3a} = 1K\Omega$ trimmer
- $R_{3_{2.0mA}} = 350\Omega \implies R_{3b} = 500\Omega$ trimmer
- $R_{3_{5.0mA}} = 140\Omega \implies R_{3c} = 200\Omega$ trimmer
- $R_{3_{10mA}} = 70\Omega \implies R_{3d} = 100\Omega$ trimmer
- $R_{3_{20mA}} = 35\Omega \implies R_{3e} = 100\Omega$ trimmer
- $R_{3_{30mA}} = 23\Omega \implies R_{3f} = 100\Omega$ trimmer

$P_{R_{3_{MAX}}} = I_{C_{3_{MAX}}}^2 * R_{3_{MIN}} = 2mW$


$V_{CE_3} = V_{CC} - V_{load} - V_{BE_2}$

Assuming $V_{load_{MIN}} = 0.3V$ (for a forward biased schottky diode) and $V_{load_{MAX}} = 18V$ (for a reverse biased zener diode):

$V_{CE_{3_{12V}}} = (2.3 - 11.1)V$ and $V_{CE_{3_{24V}}} = (5.3 - 23.1)V \implies V_{CE} = (2.3 - 23.1)V$

$P_{Q_{3_{MAX}}} = V_{CE_{3_{MAX}}} * I_{C_{3_{MAX}}} = 0.7W$

A medium-power transistor is needed for $Q_3$ with a small heatsink:

$\Theta_{jc} = 2.5^{\circ} C/W$,

$\Theta_{hs} = (5 - 10)^{\circ} C/W$

Assuming $T_A = 30^{\circ} C$:

$T_{Q_{3_{MAX}}} = T_A + P_{Q_{3_{MAX}}}*(\Theta_{tot}) \leq 40^{\circ} C$

**Control & current reference network:**<br/>
The role of the current reference network (a constant current generator) is to absorb the differences in the choice of the $V_{CC}$ value. In this way, the choice of Vcc determines only the maximum value of the Zener voltage that can be measured (tested) by the circuit. The control network (also a constant current generator) keeps the load current constant and ensures that $Q_3$ (and $Q_2$) always operates in the active zone.

$V_{CE_2} = V_{BE_2} + V_{BE_3} = 1.4V$

$2*V_D = 1.2V = V_{BE_1} + R_2 * I_{R_2}$


$V_{CE_1} = V_{CC} - V_{R_2} - V_{CE_2} \implies V_{CE_1} = (9.1 - 21.1)V$

For $Q_3$ it is better to use a Darlington (*), which has a high $H_{FE}$, so as to keep its base current small and also the reference current of $Q_1$.<br/>
Assuming: $H_{FE_3} \geq 1000$

$I_{B_{3_{MIN}}} = I_{C_{3_{MAX}}}/H_{FE_3} = 50\mu A$

So we can set: $I_{R_2} = 5mA => R_2 = (2*V_D - V_{BE_1})/I_{R_2} = 100\Omega$

$P_{Q_{1_{MAX}}} = V_{CE_{1_{MAX}}} * I_{R_2} = 115mW$

$P_{Q_{2_{MAX}}} = V_{CE_2} * (I_{R_2} - I_{B_3}) = 7mW$

$V_{R_1} = V_{CC} - 2* V_D = (10.8 - 22.8)V \implies I_{R_1} = V_{R_1}/R_1 = (.9 - 1.9)mA \implies P_{R_{1_{MAX}}} = I_{R_{1_{MAX}}}^2*R_1 = 43mW$

(*) If $Q_3$ were not a Darlington, its $H_{FE}$ would be about $15$. In the worst case ($V_{CC}=24V$ and $I_{C_{3}}=50mA$), its base current should be in the $mA$ range, so $Q_1$'s collector current should be set to at least $(10-15)mA$. Since $V_{CE_1}$ must sink virtually all of the $V_{CC}$, the power to be dissipated would require a medium-power transistor for $Q_1$ as well.

**Display network:**<br/>
The display network translates the voltage drop across the diode into a decoupled and ground-referenced signal for the digital voltmeter.<br/>
The core of this stage is the TL082 operational amplifier, configured as a unity-gain differential amplifier.
It converts the floating measurement into a single-ended output referred to GND, ensuring compatibility with standard 3-wire digital display modules.<br/>
The JFET inputs of the OA ensure virtually no current is drawn from the test loop, maintaining the integrity of the selected test current (1mA to 30mA).

*Note*: When no diode is connected, the display will show the maximum available voltage ($VCC​−V_{drop}$​). This is normal behavior for a constant current generator operating at no load.


### LTspice Simulation
Below is the simulation of the circuit with the LTspice software.<br/>
The simulation plots currents, voltages and powers on the transistors of the circuit, assuming a forward biased diode as a load. The simulation considers 2 different values ​​of $V_{CC}$ $(12V, 30V)$, for each of which the resistance $R_3$ is linearly modified from the value $15\Omega$ to $500\Omega$, and then brought back to the value $15\Omega$.<br/>
Plot 2 shows voltage as a unit of measurement on the Y-axis $(15-500V)$, but it should be read as the resistance in Ohms of $R_3$ $(15-500\Omega$)$.<br/>
For the simulation, the value $H_{FE}=1000$ was set for the transistor $Q_3$.

## Implementation and Test

### PCB Layout
The circuit was assembled on a custom PCB (protoboard).

### Calibration Procedure
Two-step process is required to align the internal measurement electronics and to set the operational test currents. This ensures that the displayed values accurately reflect the load characteristics without interference from component tolerances.

**Measurement circuit setting:**<br/>
This step balances the OA differential bridge to eliminate any residual voltage offset from the op-amp or the driver stage.
1. Power the circuit without inserting any component into the TEST termnals.
2. Short-circuit the TEST terminals using a jumper.
3. Rotate the trimmer R4b until the Volt Meter reads exactly 0.00V.

**Current ranges setting:**<br/>
This step calibrates each position of the rotary switch (SW1) to deliver the exact programmed test current through the load.
1. Connect a multimeter set to DC Current ($mA$) mode across the TEST terminals.
2. For each switch position, adjust the corresponding trimmer ($R_{3a}$ through $R_{3f}$) until the multimeter displays the target current ($1mA, 2mA, 5mA, 10mA, 20mA, or 30mA$).
